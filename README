mintest is a minimalist c unit testing library


to use mintest, a test_container must first be initialized to the value returned
by tc_setup()

tests can be added to a test_container by passing a pointer to a function with return type _Bool to the tc_add_test(test_container* tc, _Bool (*function)(void), char* label) function

when tc_run(test_container tc) is called, all tests in the test_container will be run

to clean up our test_container, tc_free(test_container* tc) is called
